### Running the app ### 

This app extends the capability of viewing, adding, modifying contacts.  All added contacts are stored in memory and will only last 
one session. The application uses routes as the core navigation.  All data is being pulled from objects, that can also be pulled 
using the "http service".  

Every module in the application has it's own controller to pull data from "contactList".
